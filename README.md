This is a simple **RESTful API** built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage a list of books.  

It's part of **Task 3** for the Web Development Internship.

Features

- View all books – `GET /books`
- Add a new book – `POST /books`

All book data is stored in-memory (no database required).
